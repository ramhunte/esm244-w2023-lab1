  in terminal 
  ls - tells you whats in the repository 
  
  
  
  
  
  ### Read in the data
```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here('data', 'sf_trees', 'sf_trees.csv'))

#new data frame with just top 5 legal status trees 
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  group_by(legal_status) %>%
  summarize(tree_count=n()) %>%
  #finds the maximum values of the variable tree_count and slice out just the top 5
  slice_max(tree_count, n=5) %>%
  arrange(-tree_count)

ggplot(data = top_5_status, aes(x= fct_reorder(legal_status, tree_count), y = tree_count)) + 
#re order into how many trees are in eahc one 
  geom_col() +
  labs( y = "Tree Count ", x = "Legal Status") + 
 #swap the axis 
   coord_flip() +
theme_minimal()
```
  
in console, summary(sf_trees) 
basic summary of data

names(sf_trees)
shows the names of the variables

in console, 
sf_trees %>% group_by(legal_status) %>% summarize(tree_count = n())

shows how many observations there are for each category within a variable
